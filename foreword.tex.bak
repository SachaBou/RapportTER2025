\chapter*{Foreword}

Let us first understand what this work constitutes.\\


For the past two months Victor, Yael, Yvon and I have studied, under the tutoring of Sarah and Julien.
This work we have been doing differs from a "classical" internship in that it was mostly bibliographic until the end whence it differed. \\
Indeed, we had a mock-up debate wherein each of us students had to take on different roles and perspectives on our common problematic, which we will mention and study further down this report.
This TER used to be a class centered around "Nuclear energy and Society", taught during the second semester of master's, its objective was to spur students into developing  their ability to communicate and debate around a science-focused subject as well as to lead bibliographic research.

Our work differs from those that came before us in that we didn't focus or research on nuclear power plants or atomic weapon proliferation but rather on space exploration and radiation shielding.\\

We hope that you will find this repo
